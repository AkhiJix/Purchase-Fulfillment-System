# Purchase-Fulfillment-System
- Created Use case and Domain models for Purchase Fulfillment System which is a subsystem of an Enterprise Resource Planning System.
- This project is developed as a part of the coursework _CS251-Object Oriented Analysis_ under the supervision of Dr. Jon Pearce at San Jose State University.
- The project is implemented in Unified Modeling Language (UML) and is developed using [StarUML](staruml.io).
- The team members include [Anthony Vo](https://github.com/bridgegade) and [Revanth Akella](https://github.com/RevanthAkella)
## Introduction
Hospitals, universities, airlines, large-scale retailers (Amazon, WalMart), governments, and armies use Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software like SAP to integrate systems that manage specific resources such as money (accounting), employees (HR), customers (Fulfillment), and inventory.

### Purchase Fulfillment System (PFS):

A Purchase Fulfillment System (PFS) is a subsystem of an ERP software, mostly seen in e-commerce sites such as Amazon and Walmart. A PFS mostly deals with the logistics behind every purchase made on the ERP. A PFS has to be in close contact with the Inventory Management System and Shipping System since every purchase depends on the Availability and the Shipping details.   

In our implementation of the Purchase Fulfillment System, the PFS handles the process of customers selecting a product, purchasing that product, and then delivering the product to the customer. Itâ€™s purpose is to ensure that the Customer, Inventory Management System and Shipping System are kept up to date during all stages of the fulfillment process.
